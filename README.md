# Kanji-Bakuhatsu

This Javascript app displays a kanji character's "exploded view" -- all components subdivided -- with associations to related kanji sharing those components.

First step: get the abridged dictionary JSON file committed, so we can use GitHub as a CDN :-)

The JSON file is adapted from kanjidic2.xml, available from http://www.edrdg.org/kanjidic/kanjd2index.html.
